    <translation id="myPhilosophy">My Philosophy</translation>
    <translation id="philosophyDetails">I believe that games are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a medium for storytelling, connection, training, and/or education. My goal is to create games that not only captivate players but also inspire, challenge, and/or educate them. As I continue my education and career, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in game development and design.</translation>
    <translation id="myHobbies">My Hobbies</translation>
    <translation id="hobbiesDetails">When I am not immersed in game development, I enjoy spending my time on various hobbies that help me stay creative and inspired. Some of my favorite hobbies are:</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyGaming">Gaming: I like playing a variety of games, from high pace shooters to 4x games, to understand different game mechanics and narratives and mostly for fun.</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyDnD">Dungeons and Dragons: I am part of a party made up of my friends; we try to play at least once a month, where I play as a player. I also participate in two online parties where in one of them I am the DM and in the other, I play as a player.</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyMTG">Magic the Gathering: I am part of a local community that organizes small game-nights at a local pub for MTG, and I also play this with friends at home.</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyAirsoft">Airsoft: I try to play this as often as my schedule allows and I'm making plans to participate in a big mil-sim.</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyBoardGames">Board and Card Games: I enjoy playing these with my friends and/or family.</translation>
    <translation id="hobbyBasketball">Basketball: This is a sport I love; I have played it for a while (and want to start again). I also try to attend at least 2 or 3 games of the Dutch club Donar a year.</translation>
