            <category>games</category>
            <description>This game is a prototype made in a weekend by 4 students from the MBO level 4 game development course. We are proud of the gameplay, but visually it could be improved. It won an award for its unique mechanics (Global Game Jam Groningen Award "Great Interaction" for most unique game mechanic/control).</description>

            <title>Before Nightfall</title>
            <description>About the game Before Nightfall (BNF for short). This game is a prototype made for my studies. BNF is a Tower Defense game in a fantasy setting where you play as a carpenter hired to defend someone’s village or castle. There are multiple creatures such as ogres, giants, demons, and bosses like slimes or dragons. For each completed contract, you earn gems that can be used to upgrade the basic towers and abilities. The game features three modes:
                #1 Career Mode: complete contracts to earn gems and unlock harder contracts, etc.
                #2 Endless Mode: play on a randomly generated map and survive as many waves as possible.
                #3 Custom Mode: set the map generator parameters yourself (map size, seed, number of waves, difficulty).

            <title>Big Cheese Donte</title>
            <description>This is an RPG prototype set in a 1920s Chicago mafia setting. You play as the son of a lower-ranked mob boss who asks you to prove you’re capable of taking over his empire.

                You must gather henchmen and battle rival crime bosses in the city to take over their territories. The ultimate goal is to overthrow your father’s greatest rival, Big Faluci.

                Once you win that fight, you earn the name "Big Cheese Donte" and become the new underworld king of the city!</description>

            <title>Time Puzzler</title>
            <description>For the Noorderpoort Game Jam 2024, I created this VR game together with three friends and fellow students in just 4 days. It was our first serious attempt at a VR game, and we won two prizes: Overall Winner (first place/most votes) and Most Complete Game. We would like to continue working on it, but we need to find the time.</description>
