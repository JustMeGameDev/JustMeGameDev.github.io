            <title>Before Nightfall</title>
            <description>About the game Before Nightfall (BNF for short). This game is a prototype game made for my study. BNF is a Tower defence game in a fantasy setting, you play as a carpenter for hire to defend someone's village or a castle. There are multiple creatures like an ogre, giant, demon, and a boss creature like the slime or dragon. For each contract you complete, you get gems which you can spend to upgrade the standard towers and abilities. The game has three modes:
                #1 Career mode where you complete contracts to earn gems to get more difficult contracts etc.
                #2 Endless mode where you get a randomly generated map and you need to clear as many waves as you can.
                #3 Custom mode where you set the parameters of the map generator yourself, like how big the map is, the seed, the number of waves, and the difficulty.

            <title>Big Cheese Donte</title>
            <description>This is an RPG prototype game based around a 1920 Chicago mafia setting. You play as the son of a low-ranking mafia boss. He has asked you to prove you're capable of taking over his empire.

                Therefore, you need to collect grunts and battle other crime bosses in the city to take over their territory. The ultimate goal is to take over the biggest rival of your dad's empire (Big Faluci).

                When you win that battle, you get the name "Big Cheese Donte" and you are the new kingpin of the city!</description>

            <title>Zombie Survivors</title>
            <description>Zombie Survivors is a game based on the idea of the Vampire Survivors Game. The controls of the game are a bit unconventional because it was developed for an arcade at my school.</description>

            <title>Time Puzzler</title>
            <description>For the Noorderpoort Game-jam 2024, I made this VR game in 4 days with three of my friends and fellow students. This was our first real attempt at a VR game, and we won two awards at this Game-jam: Overall Winner (first place/most votes) and Most Complete Game (self-explanatory). We do want to work on it further but we need to find the time for it.</description>
