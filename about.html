        <h2>Welcome to My World of Game Development and Design</h2>
        <p class="centered">Hello World! My name is Kornee Hartlief, and I am a dedicated student at Noorderpoort, currently pursuing a vocational college study in Software Development Games Level 4. With three years of student experience and currently an intern, I am passionate about creating engaging and interactive gaming experiences. While I am not highly skilled in art, my strengths lie in game development and design, and I aspire to further my education with a bachelor's degree in game design in the near future.</p>

        <img src="./img/Other/pf.png" alt="pf" style="height: 300px; width: auto ">
        <p>My journey into the world of game development began at Noorderpoort, where I am studying Software Development Games Level 4. This program has provided me with a solid foundation in game development principles, programming, and design. As part of my curriculum, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects and my current internship, which are instrumental in shaping my skills and career goals.</p>

        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        <img src="./img/Other/Phil.webp" alt="Philosophy Image" style="height: 350px ; width: auto;">
        <p>I believe that games are more than just a form of entertainment; they are a medium for storytelling, connection, training, and/or education. My goal is to create games that not only captivate players but also inspire, challenge, and/or educate them. As I continue my education and career, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in game development and design.</p>
